# Privacy policy

We do **not** store your data.

We do **not** directly collect your data (except during closed beta testing as stated below).

However, we do use the following third-party services that may collect and share your data with third parties:

- Oculus (applicable to our native Oculus Quest apps obtained through App Lab)

### Closed beta testing

To add participants to closed app release channels for closed testing, we need to collect their e-mail address. We only obtain this data if the participants provide it themselves. We do not store that address and only use it to add the participants to closed release channels of our games on selected stores. To opt out of closed beta testing, the participants can contact us via e-mail (hollowdilnik "at" gmail.com). Please refer to the privacy policies of the corresponding app stores to learn more about the use of your data.
